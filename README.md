# RS485 4-20mA Soil Temperature Humidity Moisture Conductivity EC PH Sensor
CWT-SOIL sensor is for soil temperature and moisture, PH, conductivity (EC),measurement, compared with the original German high-precision sensors and soil drying method of weighing the actual calibration, high precision, fast response, stable output. By the soil salt content of small, suitable for all kinds of soil. Long-term buried in the soil, resistant to long-term electrolysis, corrosion resistance, vacuum potting, completely waterproof.

**Important Reminder**
*The measurement of NPK adopts the general rapid detection method, so there are certain error, Use with caution for planting reference.
However, the sensor supports the function of writing NPK data. You can use standard instruments to measure NPK then write in to provide data for monitoring system.*
